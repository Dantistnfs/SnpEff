# SnpEff's Documentation


SnpEff uses `mkdocs`.
To build docs you need mkdocs-material theme installed.
`mkdocs` dependencies is included in `mkdocs-material` now (ref: <https://www.mkdocs.org/#installing-mkdocs>

```
# Go to snpEff's install dir, activate virtual environment containing mkdocs
cd ~/snpEff; source ./bin/activate

pip install mkdocs-material
```

- **NOTES**:
	- GitHub pages are published from `/docs` directory (main project's directory). This is configured in GitHub's project settings.
	- Markdown source for `mkdocs` is under `src/docs`

- Building docs: This will create `site` directory (ref: <https://www.mkdocs.org/#building-the-site>)
```
# Go to snpEff's install dir, activate virtual environment containing mkdocs
cd ~/snpEff; source ./bin/activate

# Clean directory, rebuild site, overwrite index.html
rm -rvf site/
./bin/mkdocs build
cp -vf src/docs/index.html site/
```

- Localhost web-server starting: This will create local web-site on <http://127.0.0.1:8000> (ref: <https://www.mkdocs.org/#getting-started>)
```
# Go to snpEff's install dir, activate virtual environment containing mkdocs
cd ~/snpEff; source ./bin/activate

./bin/mkdocs serve
```

- Deploying docs: You just need to copy the `site` directory to `docs` and push to GitHub
```
cd ~/workspace/SnpEff

# Cleanup old 'mkdocs' files
rm docs/*/index.html

# Copy new 'mkdocs' files
cp -rvf ~/snpEff/site/* docs/

./git/commit 'Documentation updated'
```
