# Output summary Files

SnpEff creates an additional output file showing overall statistics.
This "stats" file is an HTML file which can be opened using a web browser.
You can find an example of a 'stats' file [here](../adds/1kg.html).

### HTML summary (snpEff_summary.html)

The program performs some statistics and saves them to the file 'snpEff_summary.html' on the
directory where snpEff is being executed. You can see the file, by opening it in your browser.

!!! info
    You can change the default location by using the `-stats` command line option. This also changes the location of the TXT summary file.

!!! info
    Summary can be create in CSV format using command line option `-csvStats`. This allows easy downstream processing.

E.g.: In the stats file, you can see coverage histogram plots like this one:

**"Effects by type" vs "Effects by region"**

SnpEff annotates variants.
Variants produce effect of difference "types" (e.g. NON_SYNONYMOUS_CODING, STOP_GAINED).
These variants affect regions of the genome (e.g. EXON, INTRON).
The two tables count how many effects for each type and for each region exists.

E.g.: In an EXON region, you can have all the following effect types: NON_SYNONYMOUS_CODING, SYNONYMOUS_CODING, FRAME_SHIFT, STOP_GAINED, etc.

The complicated part is that some effect types affect a region that has the same name (yes, I know, this is confusing).

E.g.: In a UTR_5_PRIME region you can have UTR_5_PRIME and START_GAINED effect type.

This means that the number of both tables are not exactly the same, because the labels don't mean the same.
See the next figure as an example:

![type_vs_region](../images/type_vs_region.png){: .center}

So the number of effects that affect a UTR_5_PRIME *region* is 206. Of those, 57 are effects *type* START_GAINED and 149 are effects *type* UTR_5_PRIME.

How exactly are effect *type* and effect *region* related? See the following table:

Effect Type                                  | Region
-------------------------------------------- | ------

### Gene counts summary (snpEff_genes.txt)

SnpEff also generates a TXT (tab separated) file having counts of number of variants affecting each transcript and gene.
By default, the file name is `snpEff_genes.txt`, but it can be changed using the `-stats` command line option.

Here is an example of this file:
```
$ head snpEff_genes.txt
